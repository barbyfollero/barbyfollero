<p>Data visualization is the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format. It enables decision makers to see analytics presented visually, so they can grasp difficult concepts or identify new patterns. With interactive visualization, you can take the concept a step further by using technology to drill down into charts and graphs for more detail, interactively changing what data you see and how itâ€™s processed.</p>

<p>Software quality management is a management process that aims to develop and manage the quality of software to make sure the product satisfies the user. The goals of SQM (software quality management ) is to make sure the product follows regulations and meets the quality standards expected by the customer. Software quality managers have to test the product before it is released to the market and they do this by a series of steps called the software cycle in order to reveal and fix bugs before release. Their job is not only to make sure that their software is in good shape for the consumer, but also to encourage the quality culture to everyone and avoid fraud by protecting their software through proper development.</p>
