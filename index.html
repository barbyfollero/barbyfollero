<p>Data visualization is the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format. It enables decision makers to see analytics presented visually, so they can grasp difficult concepts or identify new patterns. With interactive visualization, you can take the concept a step further by using technology to drill down into charts and graphs for more detail, interactively changing what data you see and how itâ€™s processed.</p>

Their job is not only to make sure that their software is in good shape for the consumer, but also to encourage the quality culture to everyone and avoid fraud by protecting their software through proper development.</p>
